Game Name:
Shapeshift

Instructions:

There is a ball in each room, that is you in your normal form. 
There are also objects at the top of every level.
The goal of the game is to put these objects where you need to in 
order to get to the end of each level. 
The ball will spawn on each level on a blue portal, you need to 
get it to the pink portal (end).

Use the mouse to drag the object you want to move into the position you want
around the room.  It is not made obvious what each object will do until you use
it. Trial and error is key.

Once all of the objects are placed where you want them, hit the enter key to make
Claire Voyant move (she always starts to the right).

Once the end of the level is reached, it will take you to the next level. 
If you ever get stuck, Claire has the ability to restart the level. 
All you need to do is hit the 'R' key.
